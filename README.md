We have evaluated alternative software options such as PuTTY, WinSCP, and Cygwin, which are approved and commonly used for remote access and system management. However, these alternatives do not meet our business requirements for the following reasons:

PuTTY and WinSCP: While they are effective for basic SSH and file transfer tasks, they lack the integrated, multi-protocol capabilities and session management features provided by MobaXterm. This limits efficiency when managing multiple servers or working with different protocols simultaneously.

Cygwin: Cygwin provides a Linux-like environment on Windows, but it requires more configuration and lacks the user-friendly interface and comprehensive toolset of MobaXterm. This makes it less suitable for quick, seamless remote access and management tasks.

MobaXterm offers an all-in-one solution that combines the functionalities of these tools with additional features such as built-in X server, multi-session management, and graphical SFTP browser, which are crucial for meeting our business needs efficiently.
